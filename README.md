# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a fully connected feedforward neural network **from scratch in Python**, using only core libraries like NumPy. No deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used—perfect for educational purposes and understanding the math behind neural networks.

## 🚀 Features

- Built using pure NumPy
- Supports:
  - Forward propagation
  - Backpropagation
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  - Custom activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, etc.)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross-Entropy Loss
- Visualizes training loss
- Works on classification and regression problems
